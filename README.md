## Welcome to my personal website! This project is a personal endeavor aimed at exploring new technologies and showcasing my skills. The website is built using the following technologies:

### ASP.NET Core 7.0: The website is developed using the latest version of ASP.NET Core, a powerful and cross-platform framework for building web applications.
### ASP.NET Core Blazor Web Assembly: Blazor Web Assembly is a client-side web framework that enables building interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It allows for a seamless development experience with shared code and UI components between the client and server.
### Azure App Service: The website is hosted on Azure App Service, a fully managed platform that enables easy deployment and scaling of web applications. It provides a reliable and secure environment for hosting the website.
### Azure Storage Service: Azure Storage Service is utilized for storing assets, such as images or files, associated with the website. It offers scalable and highly available storage options.

This personal project serves as a playground for me to learn new technologies, experiment with different features, and enhance my programming skills. It also acts as a portfolio to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers or collaborators.

I'm excited to share my journey and progress through this website. Feel free to explore the different sections and functionalities, and don't hesitate to provide feedback or suggestions. I hope you enjoy your time here!
